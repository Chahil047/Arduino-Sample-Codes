3.3 Supply from Arduino boards are not sufficient (100 mA for transmission) - PA_BOOST

Frequency to be set to ISM band only (410-525 MHz)


Spread Factor 12 --> -141 dBm(bandwidth 7.8KHz kHz)

LoRa specifications : Page 18 in SX1278 datasheet

RF sensitivity, Long-Range Mode, highest LNA gain, Band 2 or 3, using split Rx/Tx path
7.8 kHz bandwidth --> -148 dBm    (Table 10)

LoRa is a new, private and spread-spectrum modulation technique which allows sending data at extremely low data-rates to extremely long ranges. The low data-rate (down to few bytes per second) and LoRa modulation lead to very low receiver sensitivity (down to -134 dBm), which combined to an output power of +14 dBm means extremely large link budgets: up to 148 dB., what means more than 22km (13.6 miles) in LOS links and up to 2km (1.2miles) in NLOS links in urban environment (going through buildings).
